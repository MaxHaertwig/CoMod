# Client

This is _CoMod_'s client application. It is based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and written in [Dart](https://dart.dev).

## Run

```bash
flutter run
```

The app attempts to connect to a local _CoMod_ backend. This can be changed by adjusting `_host` and `_port` in `lib/logic/collaboration/collaboration_session.dart`.

## Test

```bash
flutter test
```
